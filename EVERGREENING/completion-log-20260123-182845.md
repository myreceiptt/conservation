# Evergreen Completion Log

- Repo: conservation
- Class: C (Frozen Static Site)
- Branch: january-2026-evergreening
- Timestamp: 20260123-182845

- Verified `README.md` documents frozen policy and deploy target.

## Quarterly
- No dependency/tooling upgrades applicable (static/frozen by design).

## Notes
- Recommended manual checks remain: deployment health, headers, and any external CDN link validity.
